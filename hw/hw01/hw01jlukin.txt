Question B:

Fahrenheit Interpolation: F(t) = 32(1-t) + 212(t) ---- When t = 0, F(t) = 32 "Freezing Point" ---- When t = 1, F(t) = 212 "Boiling Point"

Celsius Interpolation: C(t) = 100(t) ---- When t = 0, C(t) = 0 "Freezing Point" ---- When t = 1. C(t) = 100 "Boiling Point"



Question C:

The graphics pipline tries to rely on the most basic shape possible. With Lat and Long lines, 
the majority of polygons will be Quadrilateral, with the ones touching the poles being triangles. 
It would be possible to use all triangles if you introduced lines other than vertical and horizontal.



Question D:

Primitive assembly combines vertex information, ie connections, color, position. 
Projection operations, clipping and culling occur in the assembly - Rasterization follows.
