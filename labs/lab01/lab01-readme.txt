The intensity values of color within the code are on a scale of 0-1. The Vec4 object holds the 3 main color values of red,
green and blue, and alpha - the transparency value. Leaving the alpha at 1, to get white you set all values to 1; for black, set to 0.
To get other red, it is (1, 0, 0, 1), green is (0, 1, 0, 1), and blue is (0, 0, 1, 1)
