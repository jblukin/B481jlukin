UPDATED FINAL PROJECT CHANGES

Wavy Terrain with a texture map plane follwing the camera and a spinnable cube in the middle

A) Terrain with bump mapping based on height generated algorithmically

	Cube algorithmically generated


B) Move a point light with mouse drag
    
   Rotate a Cube with mouse drag
   
   Both Operations always active w/ different controls
   

C) Free move camera

   Auto rotate camera
   
   Can switch between modes


D) Two lights with distinct diffuse and specular properties

   Both can be turned off independently 
   
   One can be moved using mouse drag 
   
   The other rotates around the terrain automatically
   
E) Bump map for terrain

   Bump map algorithmically generated in GPU
   
   Texture map for plane following camera
   
   Texture algorithmically generated
