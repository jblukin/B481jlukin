Realistic Clear Still Water with Depth lighting and specularity

A) Terrain with mapping of mountain texture vs beach texture based on height generated algorithmically

	Water done by shader
	
	Lighting specularity and depth buffer done by shader

B) Raise Height of water with mouse drag
    
   Move a light source with mouse drag
   
   Can switch between operations
   

C) Free move camera

   Auto rotate camera
   
   Can switch between modes


D) Two lights with distinct diffuse and specular properties

   Both can be turned off independently 
   One can be moved using mouse drag 
   The other rotates around the terrain automatically
   
E) See part A

I can't think of more details since I'm not even sure how I would implement this project.
